### Builds on the ds2 database tutorial, but on a different set of tables and domains, reinforces the intermediate / advanced techniques. Much more comprehensive breadth and depth!
### More practice, more variations that will be useful to a data-analyst, budding data-scientist/engineer working on any end of the data spectrum

### Happy Learning
